Snek - A game of Snake built for the Gameboy Advance.

In Snek, you play as a snake.
The goal of the game is to grow yourself as long as possible by consuming food.

Apples are the most common type of food.
Additionally, mice will occasionally spawn. Mice will run from you once you get close, but are worth more points.

For each apple and mouse you consume, you will grow in length and increase your score.
Don't play with your food! Your score will start to decrease if you fail to eat your food quickly enough.
The game ends when you collide with your own body or the edge of the screen.
