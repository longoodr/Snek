at each iteration of movement:
	if next tile is apple:
		remove apple
		add new head onto snake at apple location
		convert previous head to corresponding body sprite
	otherwise, if next tile is empty:
		add new head onto snake at new location
		convert previous head to corresponding body sprite
		remove tail from snake
		convert new tail to corresponding tail sprite
	otherwise:
		lose the game

headXDiff = 0

when updating body sprite:
	compute headXDiff, headYDiff
	compute prevXDiff, prevYDiff

	 HEAD	  PREV 
	X    Y   X    Y
	-1		 +1			bodyHorizontal
	-1		 	  -1	turnDownLeft

     update body sprite accordingly
